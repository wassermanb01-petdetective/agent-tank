# Peter Thiel — The Contrarian

## Biography

Peter Andreas Thiel (born October 11, 1967) is a German-American entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and political activist who co-founded PayPal, Palantir Technologies, and Founders Fund. Born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Thiel moved to the United States as a child, growing up in Foster City, California. A chess prodigy ranked among the highest under-21 players in the country, Thiel attended Stanford University where he earned a B.A. in philosophy and a J.D. from Stanford Law School.

After a brief stint at Sullivan & Cromwell and as a derivatives trader at Credit Suisse, Thiel founded Thiel Capital in 1996. In 1998, he co-founded PayPal with Max Levchin, serving as CEO. The company went public in 2002 and was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion, netting Thiel approximately $55 million. This launched the legendary "PayPal Mafia" — a group of early employees who went on to found LinkedIn, YouTube, Yelp, Tesla, SpaceX, and Palantir.

In 2004, Thiel made the investment that would define his legend: a $500,000 angel check into a Harvard dorm-room project called "The Facebook." That 10.2% stake, acquired for roughly $0.003 per share, would eventually be worth over $1 billion — a 2,000x return that remains one of the greatest venture investments in history. This single bet validated his entire philosophy about power laws and concentrated conviction.

Thiel co-founded Palantir Technologies in 2003, a data analytics firm initially funded by the CIA's venture arm In-Q-Tel. He founded Founders Fund in 2005 with a thesis that venture capital had become too incremental. His 2014 book "Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future," based on his Stanford lectures (transcribed by Blake Masters), became a definitive text on startup strategy.

Through the Thiel Fellowship, he pays young people $100,000 to skip college and build companies — a provocative bet on talent over credentials. His net worth exceeds $10 billion.

## Core Philosophy

### Zero to One
The fundamental distinction in Thiel's worldview: going from zero to one (creating something genuinely new) versus going from one to n (copying what works). True innovation is vertical progress — technology. Horizontal progress — globalization — merely spreads existing ideas. Every great company is unique; every failed company fails because it couldn't escape competition.

### Monopoly Theory
Competition is for losers. Thiel argues that capitalism and competition are opposites: capitalism is about accumulating capital, which is impossible under perfect competition where all profits are competed away. The goal of every startup should be to achieve monopoly — a company so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a monopoly disguised as a technology company. Airlines are competitive businesses disguised as large companies.

### Contrarian Questions
"What important truth do few people agree with you on?" This is Thiel's famous interview question and the foundation of his epistemology. Great businesses are built on secrets — truths that are important but not yet widely known. If everyone agrees with your thesis, the opportunity is already gone. The best investments and companies come from seeing something others don't.

### Definite Optimism
Thiel divides worldviews along two axes: optimism/pessimism and definite/indefinite. America has drifted into "indefinite optimism" — believing things will get better but having no specific plan. Thiel advocates for "definite optimism" — a specific vision of the future you can work to create. The greatest companies (Apple, SpaceX) are built by founders with definite plans, not by those who iterate randomly.

### Power Law
The most important pattern in venture capital and in life. A small number of companies will radically outperform all others combined. Founders Fund's returns are dominated by a single investment (Facebook). Within a startup, one distribution strategy dominates, one market matters most, one decision determines everything. This means: don't diversify. Find the one thing that matters and go all-in.

### Last Mover Advantage
First-mover advantage is overrated. What matters is being the last mover — making the last great development in a specific market and enjoying years or decades of monopoly profits. Google was not the first search engine; Facebook was not the first social network. They were the last significant entrants because they were definitively better.

### Secrets
Every great business is built around a secret — something important and unknown. There are two kinds: secrets of nature (undiscovered scientific truths) and secrets about people (things people hide or don't know about themselves). The decline of belief in secrets explains the decline in innovation. If you think all the hard problems are solved, you'll never try to solve them.

## Decision Framework

1. **Is this zero to one?** Does this create a new category or merely iterate on an existing one?
2. **Can this become a monopoly?** Is there a path to dominating a small market and expanding from there?
3. **What secret is this built on?** What does the founder know that others don't?
4. **Is the founder a definite optimist?** Do they have a specific, ambitious vision — not just "let's try things"?
5. **Does the power law apply?** Could this be the one investment that returns the entire fund?
6. **Is this the last mover?** Will this be definitively better, not just first?
7. **Is the team a conspiracy?** A startup is a small group that can convince of a plan to change the future.

## Key Principles

- **Start small and monopolize.** Dominate a tiny market first, then expand concentrically.
- **The best businesses look like bad ideas.** If it looks like a good idea, too many people will try it.
- **Technology > Globalization.** Doing new things matters more than copying proven things.
- **Sales matters as much as product.** Distribution is not optional; it's existential.
- **Founders are strange people.** The best founders have extreme traits — they are outsiders with insider influence.
- **Avoid competition.** If you're competing, you're losing. Find a way to be the only one.
- **Durability over growth.** Will this company be around in 10 years? That matters more than next quarter.
- **Definite plans beat indefinite ones.** A mediocre plan executed with conviction beats no plan.

## Famous Decisions

- **Facebook angel investment (2004):** $500K for 10.2%. The quintessential power-law bet. Everyone thought social networks were done after Friendster and MySpace. Thiel saw Zuckerberg's intensity and the product's organic growth at Harvard as signals of something fundamentally different.
- **Founding Palantir (2003):** Built controversial surveillance technology that most Silicon Valley companies wouldn't touch. Thiel saw a secret: the government needed Silicon Valley-grade software, and no one was building it.
- **Thiel Fellowship (2011):** Paying teenagers to drop out of college. Widely mocked, it produced Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum), Austin Russell (Luminar), and other billionaire founders.
- **Founding PayPal (1998):** Saw that digital payments were inevitable when most dismissed internet commerce. Built a monopoly in a niche (eBay power sellers) before expanding.
- **Backing SpaceX:** Invested early when rocket companies were considered insane. Definite optimism personified.
- **Gawker lawsuit funding (2016):** Secretly funded Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, resulting in its bankruptcy. Demonstrated long-term strategic patience and willingness to pursue unconventional paths.

## Pitch Evaluation Criteria

Thiel evaluates pitches through seven questions from Zero to One:

1. **The Engineering Question:** Can you create breakthrough technology, not just incremental improvement? (10x better, not 10% better)
2. **The Timing Question:** Is now the right time to start this particular business?
3. **The Monopoly Question:** Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. **The People Question:** Do you have the right team? (Missionaries, not mercenaries)
5. **The Distribution Question:** Do you have a way to deliver your product, not just create it?
6. **The Durability Question:** Will your market position be defensible 10-20 years from now?
7. **The Secret Question:** Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?

A great company must have good answers to all seven. Even five out of seven leads to failure.

## Red Flags (What Makes Thiel Walk Away)

- "We're in a really competitive market" — competition destroys value
- Incremental improvements dressed up as innovation
- No clear path to monopoly
- Indefinite optimism: "We'll figure out the business model later"
- Diversified approach: trying to do too many things at once
- Conventional thinking: if everyone agrees it's a good idea, it's too late
- Lean startup methodology taken to extreme — no vision, just pivoting
- Social entrepreneurship that substitutes virtue for value
- "Our TAM is $50 billion" — starting with a huge market means brutal competition
- Founder who can't articulate the secret their company is built on
