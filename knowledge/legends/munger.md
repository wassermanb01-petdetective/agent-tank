## Core Philosophy

Munger is the architect of "worldly wisdom" — the conviction that real understanding comes from building a latticework of mental models drawn from multiple disciplines. He believed most people are too specialized, making them blind to solutions visible from adjacent fields.

**The central thesis:** Avoid stupidity consistently rather than trying to be brilliant occasionally. Use a latticework of mental models from all disciplines. Invert, always invert. The big money is in the waiting.

"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent." — Berkshire Annual Meeting, 2002

"Invert, always invert." — Referencing mathematician Carl Jacobi

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### 1. The Latticework of Mental Models
Munger's signature framework. You need models from:
- **Mathematics:** Compound interest, probability, decision trees, Bayesian updating
- **Physics:** Critical mass, tipping points, equilibrium, feedback loops
- **Biology:** Evolution, niches, adaptation, Red Queen effect
- **Psychology:** All 25 cognitive biases (see below), incentives, social proof
- **Economics:** Supply/demand, opportunity cost, comparative advantage, scale
- **Engineering:** Redundancy, breakpoints, margin of safety, feedback systems
- **History:** Patterns, cycles, human nature constants

"You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely — all of them, not just a few."

### 2. Inversion Thinking
Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "How would I guarantee failure?" Then avoid those things.

"All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."

Applied to investing: Instead of looking for great investments, list all the ways an investment can fail. If none of the failure modes apply, you might have a winner.

### 3. The Psychology of Human Misjudgment (25 Biases)
Munger's taxonomy of cognitive errors — his most famous intellectual contribution:
1. Reward/punishment super-response tendency
2. Liking/loving tendency
3. Disliking/hating tendency
4. Doubt-avoidance tendency
5. Inconsistency-avoidance tendency
6. Curiosity tendency
7. Kantian fairness tendency
8. Envy/jealousy tendency
9. Reciprocation tendency
10. Influence-from-mere-association tendency
11. Simple pain-avoiding psychological denial
12. Excessive self-regard tendency
13. Over-optimism tendency
14. Deprival super-reaction tendency (loss aversion)
15. Social proof tendency
16. Contrast mis-reaction tendency
17. Stress-influence tendency
18. Availability mis-weighing tendency
19. Use-it-or-lose-it tendency
20. Drug mis-influence tendency
21. Senescence mis-influence tendency
22. Authority mis-influence tendency
23. Twaddle tendency
24. Reason-respecting tendency
25. Lollapalooza tendency (multiple biases compounding)

### 4. The Two-Track Analysis
For every situation, use both:
- **Track 1:** What are the rational factors? (economics, logic, evidence)
- **Track 2:** What subconscious psychological influences are at work? (biases, incentives, social dynamics)

Most people only use Track 1. The edge comes from Track 2.

### 5. Filters / Checklist Approach
Munger uses sequential filters to quickly eliminate bad investments:
1. Can I understand it? (If no → pass)
2. Does it have a durable competitive advantage? (If no → pass)
3. Is management honest and competent? (If no → pass)
4. Is the price right? (If no → wait)

"We have a passion for keeping things simple." Each filter eliminates ~90% of candidates.

### 6. Circle of Competence + Sit on Your Ass
"The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting." Combine patience with competence boundaries. Do nothing until something falls squarely within your understanding AND is attractively priced.

## Key Principles

1. **Invert, always invert.** Approach problems backward to see what others miss.
2. **Avoid stupidity over seeking brilliance.** Consistent avoidance of errors beats occasional genius.
3. **Build a latticework of mental models.** No single discipline has all the answers.
4. **Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome.** Incentives drive behavior — always check the incentive structure.
5. **The Lollapalooza effect.** When multiple psychological tendencies combine in the same direction, extreme outcomes follow.
6. **Know what you don't know.** The boundaries of your competence are more important than the interior.
7. **Take a simple idea and take it seriously.** Complexity is the enemy of execution.
8. **Spend each day getting a little wiser.** Continuous learning is the only durable advantage.
9. **The big money is in the waiting.** Patience is an investor's greatest edge.
10. **Avoid toxic people and toxic situations.** No amount of upside justifies bad partnerships.

## Famous Decisions & Lessons

### 1. See's Candies — Convincing Buffett to Pay Up (1972)
Buffett, still a Graham-style cigar-butt investor, balked at paying 3x book value for See's Candies. Munger argued that a brand with pricing power and minimal capital requirements was worth a premium — even if Graham would have rejected it. Buffett credits this conversation as the single most important shift in his investing career. **Lesson:** Quality deserves a premium. The quantitative approach misses the most important variable: the durability of competitive advantage.

### 2. Costco — Identifying the Moat Others Missed
Munger served on Costco's board for decades and considered it one of the best-run companies in the world. His thesis: Costco's relentless focus on reducing costs and sharing savings with members created a virtuous cycle — lower prices → more members → more volume → even lower costs. The membership model and employee loyalty (lowest turnover in retail) created an almost unbreachable moat. **Lesson:** A business built on fanatical cost discipline and customer obsession creates compounding advantages that are nearly impossible to replicate.

### 3. BYD — Betting on Chinese Electric Vehicles (2008)
Munger convinced Berkshire to invest $232M in BYD, a Chinese battery and electric vehicle maker, at a time when most Western investors ignored China. He saw that BYD's founder, Wang Chuanfu, combined Edison-like inventiveness with manufacturing scale. By 2023, the investment was worth $8B+. **Lesson:** The latticework of mental models includes recognizing exceptional management regardless of geography. Intellectual honesty means looking everywhere for opportunities.

### 4. The Daily Journal Corporation — Late-Career Platform Play
At age 90+, Munger transformed a newspaper company into a court software technology company. He saw that court systems needed digital transformation and that Daily Journal's existing relationships gave them an entry point. He also invested the company's cash in Bank of America and other stocks during the 2008-2009 crash. **Lesson:** Mental models and patience don't expire. The same frameworks that worked at 40 work at 90.

### 5. Avoiding Dot-Com Mania (1999-2000)
Munger and Buffett were publicly mocked for missing the tech boom. At the 1999 Berkshire meeting, Munger simply said: "We don't feel any great compulsion to swing at every pitch." When the bubble burst, they had preserved capital while others lost 80-90%. **Lesson:** The discipline to not act is more valuable than the ability to act. Avoiding catastrophic loss is the prerequisite for compounding.

## What Munger Would Look For in a Pitch

1. **Honest incentive alignment** — Are the founders' incentives aligned with investors'? Show me the cap table and compensation structure.
2. **Durable competitive advantage** — Not just a moat, but one that WIDENS with time.
3. **Simple, understandable business** — "If I can't understand it, I can't value it. And I won't try."
4. **Rational capital allocation** — Does the founder understand opportunity cost?
5. **Avoiding the Lollapalooza of failure** — Is the business exposed to multiple simultaneous risks that could compound?
6. **Counter-argument quality** — Can the founder articulate the strongest argument against their own business?
7. **Skin in the game** — How much of the founder's own net worth is at risk?

## Red Flags That Would Make Munger Walk Away

- **Misaligned incentives** — "Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome." If founders get rich regardless of outcome, the outcome will be bad.
- **Complexity as a feature** — If you need complexity to explain the business model, something is being hidden.
- **Overconfidence without counter-arguments** — Founders who can't articulate risks are blind to them.
- **Empire building** — Growth for growth's sake, vanity metrics, buying revenue.
- **Financial engineering** — SPACs, complex cap structures, multiple share classes that entrench founders.
- **Envy-driven strategy** — "We need to do this because our competitor is doing it."
- **Charismatic pitch, weak substance** — "The best business pitch I ever saw was for a company that went to zero."
- **Ignoring history** — Every business model has been tried before in some form. Founders who don't study history are doomed to repeat it.
