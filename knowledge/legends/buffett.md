## Core Philosophy

Buffett's philosophy evolved from Benjamin Graham's pure quantitative value investing to a synthesis incorporating Philip Fisher's quality-growth thinking, heavily influenced by Charlie Munger.

**The central thesis:** Buy wonderful businesses at fair prices, rather than fair businesses at wonderful prices. Hold them forever. Let compounding do the work.

"The first rule of investing is don't lose money. The second rule is don't forget rule number one." — Berkshire Shareholder Letter, 1986

"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." — Berkshire Shareholder Letter, 1989

**Owner's mindset:** Buffett approaches every investment as if he's buying the entire business, even when purchasing a fractional share. "I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am an investor."

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### 1. Circle of Competence
Only invest in what you deeply understand. The size of your circle matters less than knowing its boundaries. Buffett famously avoided tech stocks for decades — not because they were bad, but because he couldn't predict their economics 10 years out.

**Application:** Before evaluating any opportunity, ask: "Do I understand this business well enough to predict its economics a decade from now?"

### 2. Economic Moats
Borrowed from medieval castles — a durable competitive advantage that protects returns on capital. Buffett identifies five moat types:
- **Brand power** (Coca-Cola, See's Candies)
- **Switching costs** (enterprise software, banking relationships)
- **Network effects** (American Express, Visa)
- **Cost advantages** (GEICO's direct model, Nebraska Furniture Mart)
- **Regulatory/scale barriers** (railroads, utilities)

"In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats." — Berkshire Annual Meeting, 1995

### 3. Margin of Safety
Buy at a significant discount to intrinsic value. This isn't just about getting a deal — it's about being wrong and still okay. If you calculate a business is worth $100, buy at $70. The gap absorbs errors in judgment.

### 4. Management Quality Assessment
Three questions about management:
1. **Is management rational** with capital allocation? (Do they reinvest at high ROIC or return capital?)
2. **Is management honest** with shareholders? (Do they admit mistakes? Are proxy statements readable?)
3. **Does management resist the institutional imperative?** (Do they avoid empire-building, copycat behavior, and yes-men?)

"When a management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact." — Berkshire Shareholder Letter, 1989

### 5. Mr. Market
Graham's allegory: The market is a manic-depressive business partner who offers to buy or sell his share every day. Sometimes his prices are reasonable; sometimes they're absurd. Your advantage is that you can ignore him. You're never required to act.

### 6. Float Economics
Insurance premiums collected before claims are paid create "float" — money you hold and can invest. If your underwriting is disciplined (combined ratio ≤100%), the float is free leverage. Berkshire's float grew from $39M (1970) to $164B+ (2023).

## Key Principles

1. **Never lose money.** Capital preservation is paramount. Asymmetric risk/reward only.
2. **Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.** Contrarian timing, not contrarian for its own sake.
3. **Time is the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre.** Compounding requires patience and quality.
4. **Price is what you pay, value is what you get.** Always distinguish between the two.
5. **Only swing at fat pitches.** Ted Williams' strike zone — wait for the pitch in your sweet spot. There are no called strikes in investing.
6. **Keep a margin of safety.** Always leave room to be wrong.
7. **Invest in businesses a fool could run, because eventually one will.** System-dependent, not genius-dependent.
8. **Think in decades, not quarters.** "Our favorite holding period is forever."
9. **Reputation takes 20 years to build and 5 minutes to destroy.** Character and integrity are non-negotiable.
10. **Read 500 pages a day.** Knowledge compounds. "That's how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest."

## Famous Decisions & Lessons

### 1. See's Candies (1972) — The Paradigm Shift
Bought for $25M when it earned $2M pre-tax. Munger convinced Buffett to pay 12.5x earnings for a quality brand — well above Graham's cigar-butt thresholds. See's had pricing power: customers associated the brand with quality and would pay more year after year. By 2023, See's had generated over $2B in cumulative pre-tax earnings on minimal reinvested capital. **Lesson:** A great business with pricing power and low capital requirements is worth a premium price.

### 2. Coca-Cola (1988) — Betting Big on Brand
After the 1987 crash, Buffett invested $1.3B (25% of Berkshire's book value) in Coca-Cola. He saw an unmatched global brand selling a product consumed 1.9 billion times daily, with economics improving as international markets opened. By 2023, Berkshire's annual dividend from Coke exceeded the entire original investment. **Lesson:** When you find a near-perfect business at a fair price, bet big. Concentration, not diversification, builds wealth.

### 3. Passing on Tech (1990s-2000s) — Discipline Over FOMO
Buffett refused to invest in tech companies during the dot-com boom despite intense criticism. "I don't understand it" was his consistent answer. He watched the bubble inflate and burst, validated in his discipline. He later invested in Apple (2016) only when he understood it as a consumer brand with ecosystem lock-in, not a tech company. **Lesson:** Staying within your circle of competence means accepting missed opportunities. The cost of discipline is always less than the cost of recklessness.

### 4. General Re (1998) — Learning from Mistakes
Acquired General Re for $22B, which turned out to have undisclosed derivative exposure and underwriting problems. Cost Berkshire billions in losses. Buffett cleaned up the mess over years and was transparent about the error. **Lesson:** Even the best investors make mistakes. What matters is acknowledging them, limiting the damage, and learning. Due diligence on complex financial instruments is never sufficient.

### 5. The 2008 Financial Crisis — Greedy When Others Are Fearful
While markets panicked, Buffett deployed $15.6B in five weeks — investing in Goldman Sachs ($5B preferred + warrants), GE ($3B), Dow Chemical, and others. He also wrote a famous NY Times op-ed: "Buy American. I Am." These deals were structured with significant downside protection (preferred stock, warrants). **Lesson:** Liquidity and courage in a crisis are the ultimate competitive advantage. Structure matters — even in a crisis, demand a margin of safety.

## What Buffett Would Look For in a Pitch

1. **Durable competitive advantage** — What's the moat? Can it widen over time?
2. **Simple, understandable business** — If you can't explain how it makes money in one sentence, pass.
3. **Predictable economics** — Can you reasonably forecast cash flows 10 years out?
4. **High return on invested capital (ROIC)** — Does the business generate excess returns without requiring endless reinvestment?
5. **Honest, capable management** — Do founders demonstrate rational capital allocation and transparent communication?
6. **Pricing power** — Can the business raise prices without losing customers?
7. **Low capital intensity** — Does growth require proportional capital, or does the business scale on existing assets?
8. **Reasonable valuation** — Is the price fair relative to owner earnings (FCF)?

## Red Flags That Would Make Buffett Walk Away

- **Excessive complexity** — If the business model requires a flowchart to explain, it probably requires one to fail, too
- **Dependent on continuous capital raises** — "If a business requires constant infusions of capital to grow, it's not a great business"
- **Management that talks about stock price** instead of business fundamentals
- **Excessive leverage** — "Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked"
- **No clear moat** — Commodity businesses competing on price alone
- **Promotional management** — Founders who are better at fundraising than building
- **Accounting tricks** — Non-GAAP adjustments, revenue recognition games, adjusted EBITDA that strips real costs
- **Winner-take-all markets with no current advantage** — If you're not already winning, hope isn't a strategy
- **Businesses that require predicting technology shifts** — Buffett avoids what he can't predict
