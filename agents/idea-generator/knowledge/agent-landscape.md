# Current AI Agent Landscape (Feb 2026)

## Market Size
- AI agent market: $7.84B in 2025, projected $52.62B by 2030
- Fastest-growing software category in 2026

## What Agents Can Do Today
- **Code**: Cursor, Devin, Copilot — agents write, debug, deploy production code autonomously
- **Browse & Research**: Agents navigate the web, extract data, fill forms, compare prices
- **Trade**: DeFi agents execute swaps, manage portfolios, run MEV strategies (Jito Labs MEV protection), yield farming across protocols
- **Analyze**: Process documents, financial reports, legal contracts at scale
- **Create**: Generate images, video, music, marketing copy, entire websites
- **Automate**: RPA + AI = agents that handle complex multi-step business workflows
- **Communicate**: Customer service agents handle 80%+ of support tickets at companies like Sierra AI

## Key Players
- **Anthropic (MCP)**: Model Context Protocol became the standard for agent-tool interaction; most of the ecosystem consolidated around it
- **Google (A2A)**: Agent2Agent protocol launched April 2025, now under Linux Foundation — slowed vs MCP adoption
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o with tool use, Assistants API, custom GPTs
- **Cursor/Lovable**: AI-native coding agents
- **Mercor**: AI agent for hiring/recruitment
- **Sierra AI**: Customer service agent platform (enterprise)
- **Airia**: Enterprise workflow-to-agent platform, 300+ enterprise customers in 15 months
- **Safe Security**: AI-native cybersecurity
- **Fetch.ai (FET)**: Decentralized agent infrastructure, $692M market cap

## Limitations
- Agents still hallucinate and need guardrails for high-stakes decisions
- Long-horizon planning (multi-day autonomous tasks) is unreliable
- Agent-to-agent coordination is nascent — no universal trust/reputation layer
- Regulatory uncertainty around autonomous financial agents
- Most "agent" products are still glorified chatbots with tool access
