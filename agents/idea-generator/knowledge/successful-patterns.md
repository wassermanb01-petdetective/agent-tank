# Successful Patterns in Agent Businesses

## What Works
1. **Vertical Specialization** — Agents that deeply understand one domain beat general-purpose agents (Sierra for customer service, Cursor for code)
2. **Human-in-the-Loop Escalation** — Handle 80-90% autonomously, escalate edge cases to humans
3. **Data Flywheel** — Every task makes the agent smarter (Mercor's hiring data improves matching)
4. **Platform/Marketplace Model** — Don't build one agent, build the platform others build agents on (Airia)
5. **Enterprise-First** — B2B agent businesses monetize faster than consumer
6. **Protocol-Level Integration** — Building on MCP/A2A standards for interoperability
7. **Measurable ROI** — Companies demand provable value before expanding AI spend (2026 trend)

## Revenue Models That Work
- **Per-task/per-action pricing** — charge $0.10-$10 per completed task (scales with volume)
- **Percentage of value created** — take 1-5% of savings/revenue generated
- **Subscription + usage** — base fee + per-action overage
- **Infrastructure fees** — charge for compute, memory, tool access
- **Token economics** — staking for priority, earning for quality (crypto-native)

## Moats
- **Proprietary data** — unique datasets that improve over time
- **Network effects** — more agents on platform = more value for each
- **Switching costs** — deep integration into customer workflows
- **Speed/cost advantage** — 10x cheaper or faster than alternatives
- **Regulatory compliance** — being the certified/audited option in regulated industries
