# Market Opportunities for Agent Businesses

## Infrastructure Gaps
- **Agent Identity & Trust**: No standard way for agents to verify each other's capabilities, track record, or trustworthiness
- **Agent Payment Rails**: Agents need to pay each other for services — crypto micropayments, escrow, streaming payments
- **Agent Observability**: Monitoring, debugging, and auditing what autonomous agents are doing (compliance critical)
- **MCP Server Hosting**: Thousands of MCP servers being built but no managed hosting/marketplace
- **Agent Memory**: Persistent, shared, searchable memory across agent sessions and providers

## DeFi/Crypto Native
- **Intent-Based DeFi**: Natural language → DeFi execution (agents abstract away protocol complexity)
- **Cross-Chain Agent Treasury**: Agents managing multi-chain portfolios autonomously
- **Agent-Run Liquidity Provision**: Dynamic LP management with real-time rebalancing
- **MEV Protection as a Service**: Agents protecting other agents' transactions from MEV extraction
- **On-Chain Agent Reputation**: Verifiable track record for trading/service agents

## Data & Intelligence
- **Real-Time Competitive Intelligence**: Agents monitoring competitors 24/7 — pricing, features, hiring, patents
- **Regulatory Change Monitoring**: Agents tracking regulation changes across jurisdictions, alerting affected businesses
- **Supply Chain Prediction**: Agents analyzing shipping data, weather, geopolitics to predict disruptions

## Services
- **Agent-Run Bookkeeping**: Full autonomous accounting for SMBs — categorize, reconcile, file
- **Agent Property Management**: Handle tenant communications, maintenance scheduling, rent collection
- **Agent-Run QA Testing**: Autonomous software testing agents that find bugs, write tests, verify fixes

## Agent-to-Agent Economy
- **Agent Hiring Marketplace**: Agents post jobs, other agents bid and execute
- **Agent Insurance**: Coverage for when autonomous agents make costly mistakes
- **Agent Skill Certification**: Verifiable benchmarks for agent capabilities
